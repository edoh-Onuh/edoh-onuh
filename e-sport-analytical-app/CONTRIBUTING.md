## üîß Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JohnEdohOnuh/e-sport-analytical-app.git
   cd e-sport-analytical-app
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If exists
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python populate_data.py  # Generate sample data
   ```

### Code Style Guidelines

#### Python (Backend)
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused

**Example:**
```python
def calculate_kda_ratio(kills: int, deaths: int, assists: int) -> float:
    """
    Calculate K/D/A ratio for a player.
    
    Args:
        kills: Number of kills
        deaths: Number of deaths  
        assists: Number of assists
        
    Returns:
        KDA ratio as float
    """
    return (kills + assists) / max(deaths, 1)
```

#### JavaScript/React (Frontend)
- Use ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, etc.)
- Follow React hooks best practices
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Keep components small and focused
- Use PropTypes or TypeScript for type checking

**Example:**
```javascript
const PlayerStats = ({ player, onPlayerClick }) => {
  const { kills, deaths, assists } = player;
  const kdaRatio = (kills + assists) / Math.max(deaths, 1);
  
  return (
    <div className="player-card" onClick={() => onPlayerClick(player)}>
      <h3>{player.name}</h3>
      <p>KDA: {kdaRatio.toFixed(2)}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Testing Guidelines

#### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

#### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` A new feature
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat: add player efficiency scatter plot visualization
fix: resolve API timeout issues for large datasets
docs: update installation guide with MySQL setup
style: format code according to PEP 8 guidelines
refactor: extract common chart components
test: add unit tests for KDA calculation functions
chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```
